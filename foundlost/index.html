                Foundlost offers challenging expeditions in remote corners of our planet that test your physical and mental limits. Foundlost's expeditions have scientific, humanitarian or record breaking goal to&nbsp;benefit the&nbsp;world in meaningful way.
            </p>
            <p>
                I co-founded Foundlost with a goal to immerse you in nature and push you past what you thought possible.

        <h5 style="margin-top:4rem;"><strong>STORY</strong></h5> 
        <p>
            Christopher is explorer and entrepreneur. He has done amazing experiences that I wouldn’t have the guts for but he also mentioned how whenever he had some questions about life, he would go and take challenging trips like crossing the Gobi Desert on foot–which took him just under two months.
        </p><p>
            I think it’s one of those experiences that everyone should have at least once in their lifetime.
        </p><p>
            So this was probably the starting point for Foundlost and we essentially wanted to help people find those challenging expeditions that would give you both the purpose and the ability to disconnect from the existing world to find yourself while actually being lost somewhere.    
        </p>


        
       <h5 style="margin-top:4rem;"><strong>DESIGN FOR REUSABILITY</strong></h5> 

      
        <p>
            Expedition website needs to present the most essential information about the expedition. We designed a modular architecture, where each page contains modules which can be turned on and off, based on which information is available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Modules helped us build pages quickly. When a change was needed, we didn't need to redesign our pages. We just updated the module.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later, all Foundlost pages were built with reusable modules. By connecting different modules we could launch any website we needed. For example, we could quickly launch an event page before we gave a talk to students at the school.
        </p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img alt="Foundlost: Footsteps of the Nomads" src="img-blocks.jpg" style="width:1000px"/>
            <div class="alt">↑ Modules for expedition</div>
        </div>

        <h5 style="margin-top:4rem;"><strong>DESIGN FOR ZERO INFORMATION</strong></h5> 

      
        <p>
            We designed our pages in way we could launch new expeditions as soon as possible, even before all details were ready.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our architecture supported to offer different actions ranging from waitlist to booking to capture interest of explorers. This helped us to validate ideas from early stages.
        </p>
        <p>
            We made a way to launch expedition ideas when there were almost no details available. This helped us get immediate feedback from community and involve them in the planning process. 
        </p>

        <h5 style="margin-top:4rem;"><strong>MAP</strong></h5> 

        <p>
            To immerse explorer with location is the most important piece of their experience. When we didn't provide location data, we saw them searching them elsewhere and we were loosing their attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            We always tried to display as much information on the map as possible. Then we figured out we can tell more with showing less.
        </p>
        <p>
            The map consists of slides which fade. As your scroll through, the point of interest on the map gets highlighted, matching the active background.
        </p>
        <p class="awesome">
            
            <span class="quote">I think it's one of the best web native ways to present map that I've seen so far. Excited.

        <h5 style="margin-top:4rem;"><strong>RESPONSIVE FONTS</strong></h5> 

      
        <p>
            Pain point in web development was in responsivity of fonts. Typography guidelines defined atomic font styles, but they didn't guided us how to use them across different viewports. This resulted in communication that slowed down development.
        </p>
        <p>
            We built guildelines that told us which atomic texts style to use across different devices. Once we built webiste typography with responsivity in mind, we didn't need to solve responsiveness of individual text elements.
        </p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img alt="Foundlost: Footsteps of the Nomads" src="img-atomic.png" style="width:740px"/>
            <div class="alt">↑ Atomic text styles weren't enough for us</div>

        <h5 style="margin-top:4rem;"><strong>FOOTSTEPS OF THE NOMADS</strong></h5> 
        <p>
            In 2018 Foundost organised an expedition to Western Mongolia for high school students from Hong Kong, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Explorers spent 10 days with Kazakh Nomads. Then they moved to Potanin Glacier, which is the longest Mongolia's glacier. They condicted a scientific study to research its meltdown.
