                Hello—I build friendly software products.
            </p>
            <p>
                Born in Slovakia, moved to Hong Kong. I always felt delighted when I created something. To give a life to an idea. To make something that didn’t exist before.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interest in tech brought me where I am now. I think how to make something better. I work at Lalamove, which is a unicorn company expanding it’s logistics platform globally. I also help amazing teams to launch their business.

Marek is an outstanding leader, a thoughtful listener and exceptionally hard worker. Marek is obsessed with learning, he wants to live and breath the lives of his customers and stakeholders and constantly learn the cutting-edge best design practices. His background and experience mean that he is acutely aware of the importance of design in improving customer experience and driving revenues. I would not hesitate to work with Marek (and indeed still do!) and highly recommend him to those who have the opportunity to work with him.
