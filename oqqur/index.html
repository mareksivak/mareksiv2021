                Oqqur is live streaming platform for virtual tours and educational trips happening in 360° reality. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Behind Oqqur, there is fast-moving team on mission to explore new dimensionality of connecting people through live video.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>


    <div class="story-content">
        
        <h5 style="margin-top:4rem;"><strong>UPDATE</strong></h5> 
        <p>
            Soon after we redesigned streams at Oqqur, team launched its first private tours for corporates and schools. This success helped Oqqur attract partnership which empowered them to launch a mobile app.
        </p>


        
       <h5 style="margin-top:4rem;"><strong>PROBLEM</strong></h5> 

      
        <p>
            Team reached out to me to lead design of critical product adjustments that help them validate promising use cases they have identified, onboard early adopters and open doors to growth of the company.

        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, team asked me to develop visual style that would better communicate their mission, passion and cutting edge technology.
        </p>

        
        <h5 style="margin-top:4rem;"><strong>SOLUTION</strong></h5> 
        <p>
            I identified the most impactful areas of the stream page and proposed the most viable iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also developed product principles and explored how users can connect with 360 virtual experiences.
        </p>
        
        <h5 style="margin-top:4rem;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></h5> 

        <p>

         You can find 360 videos in other platforms such us Youtube or Facebook, but it's not taking off there. We think it's because 360 is treated as any other video. 
       
        </p>

        <p>
        But Oqqur doesn't think it's the same. 360 gives you a new reality. You are not limited by viewport of your device and you are no longer looking only on what streamer wants to show you. Experiences in 360 are more authentic and are different from what we know. How do they look? 
        </p>

        <img alt="Oqqur" src="_img-oqqur-old@2x.jpg" style="width:1400px"/>


        <p>
        Image above shows how a page for streams looked when I joined the team.
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
           
            The first thing I did - I asked the team to help me draft user flows to help me better understand user journey. It was messy, but served the purpose.
        </p>
        <img alt="Oqqur" src="_img-oqqur-flow.jpg" style="width:1400px"/>
        
        <h5><strong>PRINCIPLES</strong></h5> 
        <p>
            I defined two core principles that guided us. I found them on itersection of what users and the team find important. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe we will build a great product when we follow them. That's why, we question anything what we think of doing how aligned it is with them. We work only on those ideas that make the biggest leaps.
        </p>
        
        <h5 style="margin-top:4rem;"><strong>1. LIMITLESS</strong></h5> 
        <p>
            
            We wanted to remove feeling of being trapped in a box. 360 gives you freedom to look anywhere without relying on what guide shows you.
        </p>
        <img alt="Oqqur" src="_img-oqqur-unlimited@2x.jpg" style="width:1000px"/>
        
        <h5><strong>2. BONDING</strong></h5> 
        <p>
            
            We knew we cannot deliver team building experience with only chat. There is no bonding. We pursuided a vision of gathering people around guide in a way they won't realise the physical distance. 
        </p>
        <img alt="Oqqur" src="_img-oqqur-bonding@2x.jpg" style="width:1000px"/>
        
  

        <h5><strong>PEOPLE GRID</strong></h5> 
        <p>

            Viewers need to feel they are experiencing the tour with their peers and they need to see who else is there.
           
            Video feeds of joiners may be a way, but also not.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mockup below is inspired by face grids from video meetings apps - not in sense of showing video, but giving a spot to each joiner. Somewhat like physically taking a person to the spot.<br>
            Opposed to showing a list of people who are online, this concept can unlock possibilities for interaction between guides and joiners
            
        </p>
        <p>
            We can build various gadgets like asking questions, reactions, comments - all these things dont have to be in scrollable panel on side. How would it looked like if these responses were associated directly with people who produce them like in offline world?
        </p>
        <h5 style="margin-top:4rem;"><strong>COMMENTS</strong></h5> 
        <p>
            whats the point of archiving everything what was said?<br>

            They are not relevant anyway becasue context changes quickly. Showing history of comments is like showing history of your phone calls.

            If we dont remind people what they say, will they become more authentic?
        </p>
        <p>

            Will they react more? Will even passive participants become more engaged?

            If people can easily respond to their comments, how will it change conversations?

            What if each message had a timer, so it wouldnt stay forever?
        </p>

        <h5><strong>REMOVE WAITING</strong></h5> 
        <p>
            Imagine, that show starts soon and most yout team is online and everyone is looking at the same screen which tells them to wait.<br><br>

            Idea:<br>
            - show is attened by people from the same team and they know each other<br>
            - can we provide them a way to entertain themselves before guide “starts” the tour?<br>
            - stream can be delayed because guide may be struggling with technical difficulties to setup the stream - can we do something to entertain guests?

        </p>

        <img alt="Oqqur" src="_img-oqqur-roundtable.jpg" style="width:1100px"/>


        <h5 ><strong>REDUCE NON-ESSENTIAL</strong></h5> 
        <p>
        How can viewer learn how to move the viewport to look anywhere in 360?
        </p>
        <p>
        The most obvious way is to show symbol that idicate dragging complemented with possible directions to drag.
        The most important information to tell the viewer is that the screen is draggable. Once viewer discoveres that, they won't be far to discover posiible directions to drag.
        I reduced hint directions from 4, to 2 (top and bottom are less interesting, there is more to see if we guide viewer to discover horizontal drags), until I landed at one (just to tell viewer they can drag the stream to rotate angle and the rest will self-explain iteself).
        </p>

        <img alt="Oqqur" src="_img-oqqur-intro@2x.jpg" style="width:800px"/>

        <h5><strong>DELIVERABLES</strong></h5> 
        <p>
            While exploring how we can leverage 360 to connect guides with viewers, I developed a version that responds the most urgent business and engineering needs.
        </p>
